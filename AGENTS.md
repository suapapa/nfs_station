# AGENTS.md - NFS Mounter

This document provides key guidelines and context for AI agents and developers to effectively understand, maintain, and contribute to the **NFS Mounter** project.

---

## 1. Project Overview

- **Project Name**: NFS Mounter
- **Purpose**: Provide a graphical user interface (GUI) for mounting and unmounting NFS (Network File System) directories on macOS.
- **Target Platform**: macOS

## 2. Tech Stack

- **Language**: [Dart](https://dart.dev/)
- **Framework**: [Flutter for Desktop (macOS)](https://flutter.dev/desktop)
- **State Management**: MVC with `setState` and `SharedPreferences` for persistence
- **Key Dependencies**:
  - `flutter_localizations` (Required for multi-language support)
  - `shared_preferences` (For data persistence)

## 3. Architecture & Design

- **Architecture Pattern**: MVC (Model-View-Controller)
- **Directory Structure**:
  - `lib/`: Main source code
    - `l10n/`: Localization files (`.arb`)
    - `models/`: Data models
    - `views/`: UI components and screens
    - `services/`: Business logic and external services
    - `controllers/`: Logic and state management (Optional)
  - `test/`: Unit and widget tests

## 4. Coding Conventions

- **Style Guide**: Follow the official [Dart Style Guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/evolutionary-style-guide).
- **Documentation**: Provide clear comments for complex logic and public APIs.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Use `Future`, `Stream`, and `async`/`await` appropriately to ensure the UI remains responsive and never blocks.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling, especially for shell command executions (mount/unmount).

## 5. Agent Instructions

### 5.0 Scaffold the project
- Scaffold the project using the Flutter for Desktop (macOS) template.
- Ensure that the project is configured for macOS development.
- Refer `/docs/nfs_mounter_plan.jpeg` for the project plan drawing. 


### 5.1 Code Modifications
- Adhere to the established architecture patterns.
- Verify compatibility when introducing new packages or dependencies.
- **Validation**: Always run `flutter analyze` after modifications. Ensure there are no linting errors or warnings before committing.

### 5.2 UI & Localization
- **Multi-language Support**: All UI strings MUST support English (`en`), Korean (`ko`), and Polish (`pl`).
- **L10n Workflow**: 
  1. Add/Update keys in `lib/l10n/`.
  2. Run `flutter gen-l10n`.
  3. Verify that the app compiles without errors.
- **Theme**: The app uses a system theme by default. Ensure that the app is visually appealing and easy to use.
  1. Use Global Setting to change the theme, dark mode or light mode or system default.

### 5.3 Testing
- When changing logic, update existing tests or create new unit/widget tests in the `test/` directory.
- Ensure all tests pass by running `flutter test`.

### 5.4 Documentation
- Keep this `AGENTS.md` and the `README.md` updated when adding new features, changing APIs, or modifying the project structure.
